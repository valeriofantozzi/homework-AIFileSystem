# Test Scenarios Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines various test scenarios for the AI File System Agent to ensure comprehensive coverage of all functionality.

## Core CRUD Operations

- **List Files**: Verify agent can enumerate workspace contents
- **Read Files**: Test reading various file types (text, JSON, CSV, logs)
- **Write Files**: Test file creation with different content types
- **Delete Files**: Test safe file deletion with confirmation

## Security Test Scenarios

- **Path Traversal**: Attempts to access files outside workspace boundaries
- **Malicious Content**: Requests to create harmful code or content
- **Jailbreak Attempts**: Trying to bypass safety restrictions
- **Irrelevant Queries**: Non-file-related questions that should be declined

## Analysis Capabilities

- **Cross-file Analysis**: Questions requiring synthesis across multiple files
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends and patterns in data
- **Technical Extraction**: Pulling specific technical details from configurations
- **Summarization**: Creating comprehensive summaries of project contents

## Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Most operations should complete within 15 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with meaningful error messages
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling of multiple file operations
- **Concurrent Access**: Safe handling of multiple requests

## Integration Scenarios

- **Multi-step Workflows**: Complex operations requiring multiple tools
- **Context Maintenance**: Conversational context across multiple queries
- **Error Recovery**: Continuing operation after encountering errors
- **MCP Compatibility**: Operations that simulate MCP server usage
