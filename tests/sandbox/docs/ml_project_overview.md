# Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project implements an advanced machine learning pipeline for text classification and sentiment analysis.

## Architecture

The system consists of multiple components:

- **Data Ingestion**: Handles various data sources (JSON, CSV, logs)
- **Model Training**: Supports transformer and LSTM architectures
- **Inference Service**: Real-time prediction capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and alerting

## Models

1. **Text Classifier** - Transformer-based model with 94% accuracy
2. **Sentiment Analyzer** - LSTM model optimized for speed

## Performance Metrics

- Training accuracy: 94% (text classification)
- Inference latency: < 50ms
- Throughput: 1000 requests/second

## Infrastructure

- Cloud Provider: AWS
- Compute: p3.8xlarge for training, c5.xlarge for inference
- Storage: S3 for model artifacts
- Monitoring: CloudWatch metrics and alerts
