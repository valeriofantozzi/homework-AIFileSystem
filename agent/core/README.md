# 🧠 agent/core — The Brain of Your AI Agent 🚀

Welcome to the **core** of your AI agent!  
This is where autonomous reasoning, secure file operations, and tool orchestration come together to create a powerful, safe, and explainable agent.  
If the agent is the body, this folder is the **brain**. 🧠✨

---

## What’s Inside? 📦

This package implements the **ReAct** (Reasoning-Action-Observation) pattern, enabling the agent to:

- **THINK**: Plan and reason about user goals
- **ACT**: Select and execute the right tools
- **OBSERVE**: Learn from results and iterate
- **VALIDATE**: Ensure every response aligns with the user’s intent

All while enforcing **security boundaries** and **clean architecture** principles.

## Folder Structure 🗂️

| File                         | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `secure_agent.py`            | 🔐 Main agent class. Secure, autonomous, and ReAct-powered.          |
| `react_loop.py`              | 🔄 Implements the ReAct reasoning loop (think → act → observe).      |
| `llm_tool_selector.py`       | 🤖 LLM-driven tool selection for smart, language-aware actions.      |
| `goal_validator.py`          | 🎯 Validates if agent responses truly meet the user’s goals.         |
| `exceptions.py`              | 🚨 Custom error types for robust, user-friendly error handling.      |
| `tool_metadata.py`           | 🏷️ Tool metadata registry for self-describing, discoverable tools.   |
| `advanced_tools_metadata.py` | 🛠️ Registers advanced/dynamic tool metadata for plug-and-play power. |
| `__init__.py`                | 📦 Exports the public API for the core agent module.                 |

## Key Concepts & Design Principles 🏛️

- **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility.
- **ReAct Pattern**: Transparent, step-by-step reasoning for every agent action.
- **Tool Abstraction**: Tools are self-describing and discoverable via metadata.
- **Goal Validation**: Every response is checked for alignment with the user’s intent.
- **Security First**: All operations are sandboxed and validated.
- **Extensible**: Plug in new tools or reasoning strategies with minimal friction.

## Example: How It All Connects 🔗

1. **User asks a question** →
2. `SecureAgent` launches a **ReAct loop** (`react_loop.py`) →
3. The agent **selects tools** (`llm_tool_selector.py`), executes them, and **observes results** →
4. **Goal compliance** is checked (`goal_validator.py`) before responding →
5. Any errors? Handled gracefully (`exceptions.py`) with helpful suggestions!
6. All tools are **self-documented** (`tool_metadata.py`, `advanced_tools_metadata.py`) for easy discovery.

---

## Why This Matters 💡

- **Explainability**: Every step is logged and validated.
- **Safety**: No rogue file ops—everything is sandboxed.
- **Extensibility**: Add new tools or reasoning logic without breaking the core.
- **Fun to Hack On**: Modular, well-documented, and ready for your next AI breakthrough!

---

## Want to Extend? 🛠️

- Add new tools: Register them with `tool_metadata.py` for instant discoverability.
- Change reasoning: Swap out or enhance the ReAct loop.
- Improve validation: Tweak `goal_validator.py` for stricter or more creative compliance checks.
