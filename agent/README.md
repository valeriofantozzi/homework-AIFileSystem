# 🤖 agent/ — The AI Agent Engine Room 🚀

Welcome to the **agent** package!  
This is the command center for autonomous, safe, and explainable file system operations.  
Here, smart reasoning, safety, and diagnostics come together to power your AI agent. 🧠🛡️

---

## What’s Inside? 📦

- **core/**: 🧠 The brain — ReAct reasoning, secure agent logic, tool orchestration
- **supervisor/**: 🛡️ The guardian — Safety moderation & intent extraction before any action
- **diagnostics.py**: 📊 Logging, monitoring, and performance tracking
- **diagnostic_cli.py**: 🖥️ CLI for real-time diagnostics and health checks

---

## High-Level Architecture 🏛️

1. **User request** enters the system
2. `supervisor/` screens for safety & extracts intent
3. If safe, request is passed to `core/` for autonomous reasoning & tool execution
4. All actions are logged and monitored via diagnostics

This separation ensures **high cohesion**, **low coupling**, and **defense-in-depth**.

## Folder Structure 🗂️

| File/Folder         | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core/`             | 🧠 Core agent logic (ReAct loop, tool selection, validation) |
| `supervisor/`       | 🛡️ Safety moderation & intent extraction                     |
| `diagnostics.py`    | 📊 Logging, monitoring, and usage statistics                 |
| `diagnostic_cli.py` | 🖥️ CLI for diagnostics and health checks                     |
| `__init__.py`       | 📦 Exports the main agent API                                |

## Key Principles & Features ✨

- **Clean Architecture**: Supervisor (safety) → Core (reasoning) → Tools
- **SOLID**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- **Extensible**: Add new tools, reasoning strategies, or moderation logic easily
- **Explainable**: Every action is logged, validated, and auditable
- **CLI Power**: Diagnose, monitor, and debug your agent in real time

---

## Example Flow 🔗

1. User asks: “Show me all Python files”
2. `supervisor/` checks for safety & intent
3. `core/` plans, selects tools, and executes the request
4. Results and actions are logged for transparency

**Build, extend, and trust your AI agent—one safe, smart step at a time!** 🤓🦾
