# CLI Debug Output Fix Summary

## Issue

The CLI debug output was showing "UNKNOWN" instead of the correct phase names ("THINK", "ACT", "OBSERVE") for reasoning steps.

## Root Cause

- The ReAct loop formats reasoning steps with the field name `phase` (from `step.phase.value`)
- The CLI's `_display_reasoning_steps` method was looking for the field name `type` instead of `phase`
- This mismatch caused all reasoning steps to display as "UNKNOWN" phase

## Solution

Updated the CLI's `_display_reasoning_steps` method in `/chat_interface/cli_chat/chat.py`:

### Before

```python
step_type = step.get('type', 'unknown')
```

### After

```python
# Use 'phase' field from ReAct loop instead of 'type'
step_type = step.get('phase', step.get('type', 'unknown')).lower()
```

## Additional Improvements

- Made the method backward compatible by checking both `phase` and `type` field names
- Updated tool name/args handling to support both field naming conventions:
  - `tool_name`/`tool_args` (from ReAct loop)
  - `tool`/`args` (legacy format)

## Testing Results

âœ… **English Command**: `list files in current directory`

- Shows correct phases: `ðŸ’­ Step 1 (THINK):`, `âš¡ Step 2 (ACT):`
- Proper tool display with formatted JSON

âœ… **Italian Command**: `elenca i file nella directory corrente`

- Debug output shows correct phase names
- Italian translation and processing works (separate JSON formatting issue noted)

âœ… **Integration Test**: `test_final_integration.py`

- All major functionality confirmed working
- Italian support, translation, and ReAct loop operational

## Impact

- CLI debug mode now provides meaningful insight into the agent's reasoning process
- Users can see the clear progression: THINK â†’ ACT â†’ OBSERVE
- Improved debugging experience for developers and users
- Maintains compatibility with both current and legacy reasoning step formats

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

The CLI debug output issue has been successfully resolved. The system now correctly displays reasoning phases and provides clear visibility into the agent's decision-making process.
