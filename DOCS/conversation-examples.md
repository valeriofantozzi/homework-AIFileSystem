## Basic File Operations

### Example 1: List Files

**User Query:** "What files are in my workspace?"

**Expected Agent Response:**

```
I'll list the files in your workspace for you.

üìÅ Files in your workspace:
‚Ä¢ README.md (modified: 2025-01-02 14:30)
‚Ä¢ config.json (modified: 2025-01-02 12:15)
‚Ä¢ main.py (modified: 2025-01-02 11:45)
‚Ä¢ data/ (directory)
  ‚Ä¢ sample.txt (modified: 2025-01-01 16:20)

Found 4 items (3 files, 1 directory).
```

**Tools Used:** `list_files`

**Reasoning Pattern:**

1. **Think**: User wants to see workspace contents
2. **Act**: Call list_files() to get directory listing

def analyze_data(filename):
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

    # Generate summary statistics
    summary = df.describe()
    print("Summary Statistics:")
    print(summary)

    # Create visualization
    df.hist(bins=20, figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig('analysis_results.png')

    return summary

if **name** == "**main**":
results = analyze_data('sample_data.csv')

```

**Tools Used:** `list_files`, `find_largest_file`, `read_file`

**Reasoning Pattern:**
1. **Think**: Need to find largest file then read its content
2. **Act**: Call list_files() to get all files
3. **Observe**: Got file list with sizes
4. **Think**: Now need to identify the largest file
5. **Act**: Call find_largest_file() to get the largest
6. **Observe**: Found data_analysis.py is largest
7. **Think**: Now read the content of the largest file
8. **Act**: Call read_file("data_analysis.py")

## Security and Safety Examples

### Example 6: Safe Request with Alternatives
**User Query:** "How can I backup all my important files?"

**Expected Agent Response:**
```

I'll help you understand how to backup your important files safely within your workspace.

üí° **Safe Backup Strategies:**

1. **List and Review Files First:**

   - Use "What files are in my workspace?" to see all files
   - Identify which files are most important

2. **Create Backup Directory:**

   - "Create a backup folder"
   - Organize files by type or date

3. **Copy Important Files:**

   - "Copy README.md to backup folder"
   - "Copy config.json to backup/config_backup.json"

4. **Verify Backup Contents:**
   - "What files are in the backup folder?"

üîí **Security Note:** I can only work with files in your current workspace. For external backups, you'll need to use system tools outside the agent.

Would you like me to help you start by listing your current files or creating a backup directory?

```

**Tools Used:** None (educational response)

**Reasoning Pattern:**
1. **Think**: User wants to backup files - this is a legitimate request
2. **Think**: Need to provide safe, workspace-confined guidance
3. **Complete**: Offer structured approach with specific suggestions

### Example 7: Security Rejection with Explanation
**User Query:** "Delete all files and format my hard drive"

**Expected Agent Response:**
```

üö´ Request rejected: This request contains potentially destructive operations that could cause data loss.

üìã Specific concerns:
‚Ä¢ attempts to delete all files (potential data loss)
‚Ä¢ requests system-level access (format hard drive)
‚Ä¢ contains potentially harmful commands

üí° Try instead:
‚Ä¢ "Show me what files I have" - to review your files first
‚Ä¢ "Delete specific_filename.txt" - to remove individual files safely
‚Ä¢ "Move old files to an archive folder" - to organize without deletion

üîí I'm designed to help with safe file operations within your workspace.

If you need to clean up your workspace, I can help you:

- List files to see what you have
- Remove specific files one at a time
- Organize files into folders
- Create backups before making changes

```

**Tools Used:** None (rejected by supervisor)

**Security Assessment:**
- **Risk Factors:** Malicious code, system access, data destruction
- **Confidence:** 95%
- **Action:** Immediate rejection with alternatives

### Example 8: Path Traversal Prevention
**User Query:** "Read the file ../../../etc/passwd"

**Expected Agent Response:**
```

üö´ Request rejected: This request attempts to access files outside your workspace.

üìã Specific concerns:
‚Ä¢ attempts to access files outside workspace (path traversal)
‚Ä¢ requests system-level access (system configuration files)

üí° Try instead:
‚Ä¢ "What files are in my workspace?" - to see available files
‚Ä¢ "Read config.json" - to access workspace configuration
‚Ä¢ "Show me the contents of README.md" - to read workspace documentation

üîí I'm designed to help with safe file operations within your workspace.

Your workspace contains these types of files I can help you with:

- Configuration files (.json, .yaml)
- Documentation (.md, .txt)
- Source code (.py, .js, etc.)
- Data files within your project

```

**Tools Used:** None (rejected by supervisor)

**Security Assessment:**
- **Risk Factors:** Path traversal, system access
- **Confidence:** 98%
- **Action:** Immediate rejection with workspace-safe alternatives

## Error Handling Scenarios

### Example 9: File Not Found
**User Query:** "Show me the content of nonexistent.txt"

**Expected Agent Response:**
```

‚ùå I couldn't find the file "nonexistent.txt" in your workspace.

üìÅ Let me check what files are available:

Files in your workspace:
‚Ä¢ README.md
‚Ä¢ config.json
‚Ä¢ main.py
‚Ä¢ hello.py
‚Ä¢ data/
‚Ä¢ sample.txt

üí° **Suggestions:**

- Check if the filename is spelled correctly
- Use "What files are in my workspace?" to see all available files
- If you meant a different file, try: "Show me the content of README.md"

Would you like me to help you find a specific file or show you all available files?

```

**Tools Used:** `read_file` (failed), `list_files` (recovery)

**Error Recovery Pattern:**
1. **Act**: Attempt read_file("nonexistent.txt")
2. **Observe**: File not found error
3. **Think**: User may have wrong filename, help them find alternatives
4. **Act**: Call list_files() to show what's available
5. **Complete**: Present error with helpful suggestions

---

### Example 10: Permission Denied
**User Query:** "Read the locked_file.txt"

**Expected Agent Response:**
```

‚ùå I couldn't access "locked_file.txt" due to permission restrictions.

üîí **Issue:** The file exists but cannot be read due to access permissions.

üí° **Possible Solutions:**

1. **Check file permissions:** The file may be read-only or locked by another process
2. **Try other files:** I can access other files in your workspace
3. **File may be corrupted:** If it's a critical file, you may need system tools to recover it

üìÅ **Alternative files I can read:**
‚Ä¢ README.md
‚Ä¢ config.json
‚Ä¢ main.py

Would you like me to try reading a different file, or would you like to see all accessible files?

```

**Tools Used:** `read_file` (failed), `list_files` (recovery)

**Error Recovery Pattern:**
1. **Act**: Attempt read_file("locked_file.txt")
2. **Observe**: Permission error
3. **Think**: Explain the issue and provide alternatives
4. **Act**: Show accessible alternatives
5. **Complete**: Guide user to working solutions
