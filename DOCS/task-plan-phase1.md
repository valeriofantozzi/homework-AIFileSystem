- [x] **Phase 1 ‚Äì File-system & Core Tools** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

  - [x] **Task 1 ‚Äì Bootstrap `workspace_fs` package** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 1.1 Create the package skeleton under `tools/workspace_fs` with Poetry and an initial `tests` folder.  
           _Goal: empty package imports without errors._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 1.2 Define the public API surface (`Workspace`, `FileSystemTools`, custom exceptions) and add concise docstrings.  
           _Goal: any future module can import these names without touching internals._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 1.3 Configure local CI for the package (pytest + coverage, ruff, bandit).  
           _Goal: `poetry run pytest -q` and `ruff .` succeed._ ‚úÖ **DONE - 84% coverage achieved**

  - [x] **Task 2 ‚Äì Implement the sandbox** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 2.1 Implement the `Workspace` class: resolve the root directory, create it if missing, and add `safe_join()` that blocks traversal and symlinks.  
           _Guarantee: all resolved paths stay inside the workspace._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 2.2 Create custom exceptions (`PathTraversalError`, `SymlinkError`, `SizeLimitExceeded`, `InvalidMode`).  
           _Goal: call-sites can catch fine-grained errors rather than generic `ValueError`._ ‚úÖ **DONE**

  - [x] **Task 3 ‚Äì Implement file operations** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 3.1 Add `FileSystemTools` constructor with max-read, max-write and rate-limit parameters.  
           _Goal: centralise all runtime limits in one place._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 3.2 Implement `list_files()` returning filenames sorted by modification time.  
           _Scope: ignore directories and hidden files._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 3.3 Implement `read_file(filename)` with size check and UTF-8 fallback decoding.  
           _Guarantee: never reads more than `max_read` bytes._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 3.4 Implement `write_file(filename, content, mode)` with mode validation (`w` / `a`) and file-locking.  
           _Guarantee: respect `max_write` and prevent concurrent corruption._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 3.5 Implement `delete_file(filename)` that removes a file after symlink and scope checks.  
           _Goal: return `"deleted"` on success or raise `FileNotFoundError`._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 3.6 Add an internal rate-limit guard that raises `RateLimitError` when calls/second exceed the threshold.  
           _Prevents infinite tool loops._ ‚úÖ **DONE**

  - [x] **Task 4 ‚Äì Test suite for `workspace_fs`** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 4.1 Create fixture `tmp_ws` providing a temporary workspace with low limits.  
           _Reusable by all tests in this phase._ ‚úÖ **DONE** (fixtures: `temp_workspace`, `fs_tools`)
    - [x] 4.2 Write traversal and symlink rejection tests.  
           _Expect specific custom exceptions._ ‚úÖ **DONE** (comprehensive security tests)
    - [x] 4.3 Write size-limit and rate-limit enforcement tests.  
           _Ensure limits trigger reliably._ ‚úÖ **DONE** (all limits tested)
    - [x] 4.4 Write happy-path CRUD tests, including delete flow and list refresh.  
           _Goal: validate normal operation under limits._ ‚úÖ **DONE** (39 total tests)
    - [x] 4.5 Reach ‚â• 80% coverage for the `workspace_fs` package.  
           _Coverage gate in CI._ ‚úÖ **DONE - 84% achieved, exceeds minimum**

  - [x] **Task 5 ‚Äì Build `crud_tools` package** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 5.1 Generate package skeleton at `tools/crud_tools`.  
           _Independent Poetry project._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 5.2 Implement factory wrappers that expose `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `delete_file` as Pydantic-AI tools.  
           _Return functions already decorated for the agent._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 5.3 Implement `answer_question_about_files(query)` tool:  
           _Reads a capped sample of files, streams content to a lightweight LLM, returns a synthesized answer._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 5.4 Add unit tests using a `FakeChatModel` to validate tool wiring and multi-file summarisation logic.  
           _Goal: deterministic results without live LLM calls._ ‚úÖ **DONE** (78% coverage, 19 tests)

  - [x] **Task 6 ‚Äì Package documentation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 6.1 Write a README for each package with usage examples and the public API.  
           _Audience: other developers who may reuse the library._
    - [x] 6.2 Add an initial CHANGELOG (`v0.1.0 ‚Äì first stable release`).  
           _Sets precedent for semantic versioning._

  - [x] **Task 7 ‚Äì Repository wiring** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 7.1 Declare editable path dependencies for both packages in the root `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`).  
           _Enables one-shot installation of the entire repo._
    - [x] 7.2 Update `agent/__init__.py` to import and register the five tools for later phases.  
           _Ensures the agent sees them without extra glue code later._
    - [x] 7.3 Create `scripts/smoke_fs.py`: writes, reads, deletes a file and prints results.  
           _Quick manual sanity check for reviewers._

  - [x] **Task 8 ‚Äì Environment & Model Configuration System** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    - [x] 8.1 Design and implement centralized configuration system (`config/model_config.py`, `config/env_loader.py`).  
           _Goal: Support multiple providers, roles, and environments with clean separation of concerns._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 8.2 Create comprehensive environment templates (`.env.*.template` files) for all deployment contexts.  
           _Goal: Secure, developer-friendly setup with no secrets in version control._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 8.3 Implement CLI tool (`config/manage_env.py`) for environment setup, validation, and management.  
           _Goal: Simple onboarding and configuration validation workflow._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 8.4 Add YAML-based model configuration (`config/models.yaml`) with provider capabilities.  
           _Goal: Flexible model assignment and easy provider switching._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 8.5 Create demonstration script (`config/demo_env_system.py`) and setup documentation (`config/ENV_SETUP.md`).  
           _Goal: Clear examples and comprehensive user guidance._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 8.6 Update `.gitignore` to protect sensitive files while allowing templates.  
           _Goal: Security by default with developer convenience._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
    - [x] 8.7 Validate end-to-end configuration loading, environment switching, and API key management.  
           _Goal: Ensure robust operation across all environments and providers._ ‚úÖ **DONE**
