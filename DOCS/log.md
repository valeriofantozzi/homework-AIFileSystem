- All existing CI infrastructure files

**Quality Gates Results**:

- ✅ **Code Style**: ruff linting (0 errors)
- ✅ **Code Formatting**: ruff format (all files properly formatted)
- ✅ **Security**: bandit analysis (0 security issues)
- ✅ **Testing**: pytest with coverage (39/39 tests pass, 84% coverage)
- ✅ **Automation**: Both `make ci` and `python ci_validate.py` work flawlessly

**Test Coverage Breakdown**:

- `fs_tools.py`: 84% coverage (17 uncovered lines in error paths)
- `workspace.py`: 73% coverage (11 uncovered lines in edge cases)
- `exceptions.py`: 95% coverage (2 uncovered lines in **str** methods)
- `__init__.py`: 100% coverage

**Architecture Compliance**:

- ✅ High Cohesion: Each class has single, well-defined responsibility
- ✅ Low Coupling: Clean dependency injection via constructor
- ✅ SOLID: All principles followed, particularly DIP through workspace abstraction
- ✅ Clean Testing: Tests are organized by behavior, not just API surface

**Usage Examples Verified**:

```bash
# Quick CI validation
make ci

# Comprehensive validation with detailed reporting
python ci_validate.py

# Test-driven development workflow
poetry run pytest tests/test_behavior.py -v
```

**Ready for Next Phase**: The `workspace_fs` package is now production-ready with:

- Complete implementation of all core functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage exceeding quality gates
- Automated CI pipeline ensuring code quality
- Security controls preventing common attack vectors

### Environment & Model Configuration System Implementation

#### ✅ Task 8 - Complete Configuration System (COMPLETED)

**Status**: DONE  
**Completed**: 2025-01-15

**Implementation Overview**:

Implemented a comprehensive environment and model configuration system that provides:

- Multi-environment support (local, development, testing, production)
- Multi-provider flexibility (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, local)
- Role-based model assignment (agent, orchestrator, file_analysis, chat)
- Secure API key management with template-based setup

**Files Created**:

```
