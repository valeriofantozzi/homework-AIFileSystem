## Documentation Organization

This directory contains **user-facing documentation** only. Development artifacts, logs, and internal documentation have been moved to the `dev/` directory to maintain clear separation between:

- **User Documentation** (this directory): Guides, architecture docs, and reference materials for end users and new developers
- **Development Documentation** (`dev/docs/`): Implementation summaries, debugging guides, and development artifacts
- **Development Planning** (`dev/planning/`): Task planning, phase documentation, and project management

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

- **User guides, architecture docs, troubleshooting** → This directory (`DOCS/`)
- **Implementation details, debugging, development logs** → `dev/docs/`
- **Planning, task breakdowns, project management** → `dev/planning/`

Keep documentation focused on the target audience and maintain clear, actionable content with examples where appropriate.
