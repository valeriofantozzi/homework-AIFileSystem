## Architecture Integration

### MCP Server Architecture

```
MCP Client (Claude/Cursor)
    ↓ HTTP POST /mcp
FastAPI Server (server/api_mcp/)
    ↓ DI injection
SecureAgent (agent/core/)
    ↓ tool calls
Workspace Tools (tools/workspace_fs/)
    ↓ audit events
Monitoring System (observability/)
```

### Configuration Management

- Leverage existing `config/` system for environment-specific MCP settings
- Use role-based model assignment for different MCP client types
- Maintain security through existing sandbox and supervisor mechanisms

### Quality Assurance

- Extend existing test suite to cover MCP protocol compliance
- Maintain 80%+ coverage requirement including server endpoints
- Add integration tests for actual MCP client connections
