## Success Criteria

- [ ] MCP server responds correctly to Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE clients
- [ ] Production deployment supports concurrent users with <200ms response times
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Load testing demonstrates stable performance under expected traffic
- [ ] Documentation enables new users to integrate the agent successfully
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting provide comprehensive operational visibility

## Architecture Integration

### MCP Server Architecture

```
MCP Client (Claude/Cursor)
    ↓ HTTP POST /mcp
FastAPI Server (server/api_mcp/)
    ↓ DI injection
SecureAgent (agent/core/)
    ↓ tool calls
Workspace Tools (tools/workspace_fs/)
    ↓ audit events
Monitoring System (observability/)
```

### Configuration Management

- Leverage existing `config/` system for environment-specific MCP settings
- Use role-based model assignment for different MCP client types
- Maintain security through existing sandbox and supervisor mechanisms

### Quality Assurance

- Extend existing test suite to cover MCP protocol compliance
- Maintain 80%+ coverage requirement including server endpoints
- Add integration tests for actual MCP client connections

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Duration**: 4 days

- Day 1: Tasks 1-2 (Core MCP implementation)
- Day 2: Task 3 (Production deployment)
- Day 3: Tasks 4-5 (Monitoring and security)
- Day 4: Task 6 (Documentation and testing)

This schedule aligns with your original 4-day sprint timeline and maintains the high-quality engineering standards established in Phases 1 and 2.
