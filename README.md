# AI File System Agent

A production-ready, secure AI agent that provides intelligent file system operations through natural language interaction. Built with Pydantic-AI and featuring a multi-layered security architecture, the agent can safely perform complex file operations while maintaining strict safety boundaries.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd homework-AIFileSystem
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set up environment:**

   ```bash
   cp config/env/.env.example config/env/.env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your API keys
   ```

4. **Initialize the sandbox:**
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m tools.workspace_fs.workspace init
   ```

### Basic Usage

**Start the interactive chat interface:**

```bash
poetry run python -m chat_interface.cli_chat.chat
```

**Example conversation:**

```
You: List all files in my workspace
Agent: I'll help you list all files. Let me explore your workspace.

[Agent uses file system tools to list files and provides organized output]

You: Find the largest file and show me its contents
Agent: I'll find the largest file and display its contents for you.

[Agent chains multiple operations: list files → identify largest → read contents]
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The AI File System Agent follows a modular, secure-by-design architecture:

### Core Components

- **🤖 Agent Core** (`agent/core/`): The main reasoning engine with ReAct loop
- **🛡️ Supervisor** (`agent/supervisor/`): Lightweight security gatekeeper
- **🔧 Tools** (`tools/`): File system operations and CRUD utilities
- **💬 Chat Interface** (`chat_interface/`): Command-line interaction layer
- **⚙️ Configuration** (`config/`): Environment and model management

### Security Architecture

1. **Multi-layered Content Filtering**: Detects harmful requests before processing
2. **Two-phase Model Processing**: Fast rejection using lightweight models
3. **Sandboxed Execution**: All file operations contained within safe boundaries
4. **Structured Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes with recovery suggestions

### Tool Integration

The agent provides 5 core file system operations:

- `list_workspace_files`: Directory and file listing
- `read_file_content`: Safe file reading with encoding detection
- `create_new_file`: File creation with conflict resolution
- `update_file_content`: Content modification with backup
- `delete_file`: Secure file deletion with confirmation

# Tool integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/

# Safety and security tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/supervisor/
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup

1. **API Keys**: Configure in `config/env/.env.local`

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_key
   ```

2. **Model Selection**: Edit `config/models.yaml`

   ```yaml
   roles:
     agent: "gpt-4o" # Main reasoning model
     supervisor: "gpt-4o-mini" # Fast security model
   ```

3. **Workspace Configuration**: Automatic sandbox initialization

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed reasoning logs:

```bash
poetry run python -m chat_interface.cli_chat.chat --debug
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Content Moderation**: Blocks harmful or inappropriate requests
- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevents prompt injection attacks
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Operations limited to designated workspace
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking for security review
